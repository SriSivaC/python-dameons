# python-dameons
python-dameons is collection of python modules to run an application as a daemon.

I was looking to daemonise a python process when stumbled upon [this link](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017130434/http://www.jejik.com/articles/2007/02/a_simple_unix_linux_daemon_in_python/) at [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/473620/how-do-you-create-a-daemon-in-python)

*_I am not the original author of the code_*, all credits go to [Sander Marechal](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101022405/http://www.jejik.com/authors/sander_marechal/).
He wrote this beautiful peice of code and shared it [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017130434/http://www.jejik.com/articles/2007/02/a_simple_unix_linux_daemon_in_python/)

Then an anonymous user also created code for python3x which can be downloaded [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017130434/http://www.jejik.com/files/examples/daemon3x.py)


You can find examples on how to deamonize your process as daemon*x_example.py
